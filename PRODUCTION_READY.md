## 🚦 Production Deployment Checklist

### Required Steps

- [ ] Set `ORSHOT_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Configure production environment (`NODE_ENV=production`)
- [ ] Set appropriate log level (`LOG_LEVEL=info` or `warn`)
- [ ] Review security configuration in `.env`
- [ ] Test API connectivity with `check-api-status` tool
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS certificates for API endpoints
- [ ] Set up log aggregation and monitoring

### Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Configure rate limiting if needed
- [ ] Set up caching for frequently accessed templates
- [ ] Configure telemetry and metrics collection
- [ ] Set up alerting for errors and performance issues
- [ ] Configure load balancing for high availability (multiple instances)
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Configure system service monitoring (systemd/pm2)

## 🔍 Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **API Response Times**: Track latency to Orshot API
- **Error Rates**: Monitor 4xx and 5xx response rates
- **Request Volume**: Track usage patterns and peaks
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks
- **Template Usage**: Track most/least used templates
- **Auto-mapping Success**: Monitor field mapping accuracy

### Recommended Alerts

- API error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Average response time > 10 seconds
- Memory usage > 80% for 10 minutes
- Disk space < 10% remaining
- Process restart loops (systemd/pm2)
- SSL certificate expiration warnings

## 🛠 Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Tasks

- **Weekly**: Review error logs and performance metrics
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies and security patches
- **Quarterly**: Review and update configuration
- **Annually**: Review security settings and access controls

### Update Process

1. Test updates in staging environment
2. Run security audits: `npm run security-check`
3. Execute test suite: `npm test`
4. Update version and changelog
5. Deploy with zero-downtime rolling updates
6. Monitor for issues post-deployment

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: ~50-100MB typical, ~200MB peak
- **CPU**: Low usage, spikes during image generation
- **Network**: Dependent on Orshot API usage
- **Disk**: Minimal (stateless application)

### Scalability

- **Horizontal**: Easily scalable (stateless design)
- **Vertical**: Minimal resource requirements
- **Throughput**: Limited primarily by Orshot API rate limits
- **Latency**: 1-5 seconds typical (includes API round-trip)
- **Deployment**: Simple Node.js process, no containers required
